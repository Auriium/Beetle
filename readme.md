# **Beetle**
_A collection of semicentralized utilities for Java development_

**please review this readme a248**

An easy to use, powerful and modular utility system meant to be the replacement and killer for ElytraForce's old aUtils system.
Beetle has a large focus on being object oriented and scalable.

# What does it provide?

Beetle is a decentralized software, so multiple applications will each have their own Beetle to work with (no sharing!)

- A centralized source for safe sync/async runnable execution
- A centralized file registration and loading system
- A centralized command management and registration system (+ super modular node commands with Branch)
- A centralized logger with the Beetle name that simply delegates to the platform, or slf4j
- A centralized service registry
- A semicentralized transactional data interaction system for SQL dialects
- A collection of decentralized utility classes for collections
- A collection of decentralized exceptions for specific purposes

# What platforms does Beetle operate on?

- Spigot
- **Paper**
- **Velocity** (Soon!)
- Bungeecord (Soon!)
- Discord(Soon!)
- Generic Java
- Literally any other platform you can think of thanks to the power of interfaces
