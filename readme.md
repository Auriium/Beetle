# Warning: The entire project is due for a huge reformatting!!
# **Beetle**
_A collection of semicentralized utilities for Java development_

An easy to use, powerful and modular utility system meant to be the replacement and killer for ElytraForce's old aUtils system.
Beetle has a large focus on being object oriented and scalable.


# What does Beetle offer?

- Service registry
- File management and configuration
- Flexible data storage with transactional-style handling, abstracted between multiple layers of interfaces.
- Runner / taskfutures, a mashup of completablefutures with features like taskchain
- Basic command binding system for platforms that support commands (Check out Branch!)
- Randomizers
- (soon) Data messaging channels

# What platforms does Beetle operate on?

- Spigot
- **Paper**
- **Velocity** (Soon!)
- Bungeecord (Soon!)
- Discord(Soon!)
- Generic Java
- Literally any other platform you can think of thanks to the power of interfaces
